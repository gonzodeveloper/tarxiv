# The Transient Arxiv project
---------
Astro-Colibri 3rd Workshop - Paris 2024 (16th-20th September)

### Motivation and History 
The Tarxiv (Transient Arxiv) database centralises in one service the light curves and contextual information (including TNS alerts) of Transients seen by ZTF, ATLAS, ASAS-SN (and **TBD**) since [DATE].
It is designed to allow easy access to data that has historically been decentralised and enable archival searches of transient behaviours on a large scale. 

It follows in the footsteps of Open Science projects like the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), the Open Supernova Catalogue ([Github](https://github.com/astrocatalogs/supernovae) - [Guillochon et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...835...64G/abstract)), the [AstroCats](https://github.com/astrocatalogs/astrocats) initiative and [Otter](https://github.com/astro-otter/otter-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#otter-docker). 

Our philosophy is that most astronomers do not have time or resources to compile their currated catalogues of events, and that explosive transients such as TDEs and Supernovae and even galactic events like Cataclysmic Variables should not have segregated search environments. 
A centralised archive of transient lightcurves not only enables discovery and rediscovery of data but also facilitates citing the data creators. 

The scope of the Tarxiv is currently limited to optical data but in spirit should extend to high energy transients and gravitational wave transients to enable multi-messenger archival searches. 


### Usage
You can query the Tarxiv using **[API]** and **[FRONTEND?]**.

This database is also aimed at facilitating micro-services provided by [Astro-Colibri](https://astro-colibri.science/) such as [BLA] and [BLA].

### Examples
